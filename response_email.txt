3. Are there students who, when active, hardly access the curriculum? If so, what information do you have about these students?


4. Is there any suspicious activity, such as users/machines/etc accessing the curriculum who shouldnâ€™t be? Does it appear that any web-scraping is happening? Are there any suspicious IP addresses?
    The IP address 97.105.19.58 has exhibited unusual activity that raises suspicions regarding its legitimacy and purpose of access.
    The IP demonstrated an extraordinarily frequent access pattern, with an average time of approximately 3 minutes and 7 seconds between logs, and the shortest time between logs being immediate.
    The earliest and latest access times recorded were 06:09 and 23:34:11, respectively, spanning a wide range throughout the day.
    A strikingly high number of 402 different users have been associated with this IP address, which is atypical for conventional usage patterns.



7. Which lessons are least accessed?
    A notable number of lessons(60), such as "0_Classification_Algorithms", "2.0_Intro_Stats", and "8.0_Intro_Module", among others, have been accessed just once.
